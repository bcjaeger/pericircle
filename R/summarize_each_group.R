#' Extends dplyr::summarize
#'
#'  The extensions are:
#'
#'  1. An overall result is always included.
#'  2. Multiple groups can be summarized over.
#'
#' either pass a grouped data frame or provide `groups` input,
#'   and this function will run summarize based on what is provided
#'   in `...` overall and in each group, separately.
#'
#' @param data a data frame
#'
#' @param ... R expressions to run in `summarize`
#'
#' @param groups character vector with data names to use as groups
#'
#' @param include_overall logical or character value. If `TRUE`, then
#'   the summary will be computed in each group as well as overall, and
#'   the overall group will be called ".overall". If `FALSE`, no overall
#'   stat is included. If `include_overall` is provided as a character value,
#'   e.g., `include_overall = "foo"`, then the summary will be computed
#'   in each group as well as overall, and the overall group will be called
#'   `"foo"`.
